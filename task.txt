Create a model named "PublicPost"
the model will have below fields:
  - user(foreign key->ondelete cascade);
  - title(string)
  - post(text)
  - files(array)(max 3 files)



create following routes:
  "/public/post" -> (methode: get) (middleware: auth) -> name("public.post")
        --> this route will show all latest posts. Use pagination.
        --> Blade template for this route inside "views/global/post/"  (explore.blade.php)

  "/user/{user_id}/post" (methode: get) (middleware: auth) -> name("user.post.all")
        --> this route will show all the posts from a perticular user. Use pagination for this also.  
            The posts will be shown in the users profile page. But for now just create a separate template.
        --> Blade template for this route inside "views/global/post/"  (user_post.blade.php)

  "/user/{user_id}/post/{post_id}" (methode: get) (middleware: auth) -> name("user.post.single")
        --> this route will show specific post from a perticular user
        --> Blade template for this route inside "views/global/post/"  (user_post_single.blade.php)  

  "/public/post/create" -> (methode: post) (middleware: auth) -> name("public.post.create")
        --> this route will show the form for Creating a post
        --> Blade template for this route inside "views/global/post/"  (create.blade.php)

  "/public/post/store" -> (methode: post) (middleware: auth) -> name("public.post.store")
        --> this route will store a post in the database

  "/public/post/edit" -> (methode: post) (middleware: auth) -> name("public.post.edit")
        --> this route will show the form for update
        --> Blade template for this route inside "views/global/post/"  (edit.blade.php)
  
  "/public/post/update" -> (methode: post) (middleware: auth) -> name("public.post.update")
        --> this route will update a post in the database

  "/public/post/delete" -> (methode: delete) (middleware: auth) -> name("public.post.delete")
        --> this route will delete a post from the database




Create a controller named "PublicPostController"
the controller will have the methods same name as the routes.
